## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: A leak-scan hit names where it matched and what matched
A hit from the added-content scan SHALL name the file it matched in and what
matched: the signature's own identifier for a built-in signature, and the
configured marker's position in the project's marker list for a private
marker. It SHALL NOT print the matched text, nor the marker's value: a private
marker is itself the sensitive string, which is why it is named by position. A
path that carries a secret SHALL NOT be printed either — neither one
containing a configured marker nor one matching a built-in signature — and
SHALL be described the way that marker or signature is named.

The scan that refuses one captured artefact reports the categories it matched
and no location: the caller named the artefact it offered, so there is no file
to add.

A caller that renders hits into a document of its own — the merge transcript —
MAY bound how many it shows, and SHALL say how many it did not. A caller whose
whole output is the list of places to look SHALL NOT bound it: the operator ran
it to learn where every hit is.

#### Scenario: a built-in signature names its file and itself
- **WHEN** the scan matches a built-in signature in an added line
- **THEN** the hit names the file and the signature, and the matched text
  appears nowhere in the output

#### Scenario: a private marker is named by position, not by value
- **WHEN** the scan matches a configured private marker
- **THEN** the hit names the file and which marker of the configured list
  matched, and the marker's value appears nowhere in the output

#### Scenario: a path that carries a marker is described, not printed
- **WHEN** the file a hit matched in has a path containing a configured marker
- **THEN** the rendering describes the path by that marker's position and the
  marker's value appears nowhere in the output

#### Scenario: a path that is itself a key is described, not printed
- **WHEN** the file a hit matched in has a path that matches a built-in
  signature
- **THEN** the rendering describes the path by that signature's name and the
  characters that matched appear nowhere in the output

#### Scenario: an artefact refusal reports what matched, not where
- **WHEN** the scan refuses one captured artefact
- **THEN** the refusal names the categories that matched and names no file

#### Scenario: the merge boundary reports the same detail
- **WHEN** the gate's added-content scan finds a hit
- **THEN** its line carries the same file and identification the standalone
  command gives

#### Scenario: the transcript's line is bounded and says what it left out
- **WHEN** the gate's added-content scan finds more hits than its line shows
- **THEN** the line shows the first of them and says how many it did not show

#### Scenario: the standalone command shows every place to look
- **WHEN** the standalone leak-scan command finds more hits than the gate's
  line would show
- **THEN** every hit appears in its output
